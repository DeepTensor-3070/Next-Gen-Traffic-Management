# 🚦 Next-Gen Traffic Management

An AI-powered traffic signal control system that uses computer vision to dynamically manage traffic flow in real time — replacing fixed-timer signals with intelligent, adaptive control.

---

## 📌 Overview

Next-Gen Traffic Management leverages Python and OpenCV to detect and analyze live traffic density at intersections. Instead of relying on pre-set signal timers, the system dynamically adjusts green/red light durations based on actual vehicle presence — reducing congestion and improving throughput.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 **Real-time video feed processing** using OpenCV
- 🚗 **Vehicle detection** via frame differencing / contour analysis
- 🧠 **Adaptive signal timing** based on detected traffic density
- 🔄 **Multi-lane support** for intersection management
- 📊 **Live visual feedback** with annotated video output

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DeepTensor-3070/Next-Gen-Traffic-Management.git
cd Next-Gen-Traffic-Management

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the application
python main.py
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place your traffic video file (or configure a webcam feed) in the `assets/` folder.
2. Update the video source path in `main.py` if needed.
3. Run `python main.py` — the system will begin detecting vehicles and controlling signals adaptively.
4. Press `q` to quit the live window.

## 🧠 How It Works

```
Video Feed → Frame Preprocessing → Vehicle Detection → Density Estimation
                                                              ↓
                                              Signal Timer Adjusted Dynamically
                                                              ↓
                                              Annotated Output Displayed / Saved
```

1. **Frame Capture** — Reads frames from a video file or live camera.
2. **Background Subtraction / Contour Detection** — Identifies moving vehicles using OpenCV.
3. **Density Calculation** — Counts vehicles per lane/zone.
4. **Signal Control Logic** — Allocates green time proportionally to traffic load.
5. **Output** — Displays annotated frames with signal state and vehicle count overlays.
